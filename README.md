# LVS_App
Lee Virtual School, Fort Myers, Florida

The purpose of this project will be to develop a cross platform mobile application using Xamarin.Forms for Lee Virtual School (LVS). The mobile app will act as a hub for all things LVS. The goal is to have a centralized location for information and resources. The project will be developed for both iOS and Android mobile platforms. Users on these platforms will utilize the app to apply to be a student of LVS, track their attendance, view a calendar of events and more. While using secure protocols this app will communicate with databases hosted by LVS to allow in app functionality as opposed to just a shell of a mobile web page. The goal of this project is to create a mobile app that teachers and students alike will gladly utilize.
